PEP: Unify type name formatting

Abstract
========

Change how type names are formatted in Python and C to no longer format
type names differently depending on how types are implemented. Add new
convenient API for that. Also, put an end to the cargo cult of
truncating type names in C.

Rationale
=========

Qualified name
--------------

Python 3.3 added qualified names to types with `PEP 3155 â€“ Qualified
name for classes and functions <https://peps.python.org/pep-3155/>`_.

Standard library
----------------

In the Python standard library, there are many functions formatting
a type name or the type name of an objects, with different formats.
Main ways to format a type name.

Python:

* XXX

C:

* XXX

Formatting a type in C is inconsistent
--------------------------------------

Common code pattern to format a object type name in C::

    PyErr_Format(..., "... %s ...", Py_TYPE(obj)->tp_name);

The problem is that ``PyTypeObject.tp_name`` is different depending on
the type implementation:

* Static types and heap types in C: ``type.__fully_qualified_name__``
  fully qualified name
* Python class: ``type.__name__`` short name


Truncate type names in C
------------------------

The PEP-399 requires that C accelerator behaves exactly as Python, but a
lot of C code truncates type name to an arbitrary length: 80, 100, 200,
up to 500 (not sure if it's a number of bytes or characters).

In 1998, when the ``PyErr_Format()`` function was added, the
implementation used a fixed buffer of 500 bytes. In 2001, it was
modified to allocate a dynamic buffer on the heap. Too late, the cargo
cult is to use ``"%.100s"`` format and nobody reminds why.

Issue: `Replace %.100s by %s in PyErr_Format(): the arbitrary limit of
500 bytes is outdated <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/55042>`__
(2011).

Recent C API changes
--------------------

Python 3.11 added `the PyType_GetQualName() function
<https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_GetQualName>`_ to
the C API.


Specification
=============

* Add ``type.__fully_qualified_name__``.
* Add ``%T`` and ``%#T`` formats to ``PyUnicode_FromFormat()``.
* Add ``PyType_GetFullyQualName()`` function.
* Recommend to no longer truncate type names in C code.
* Recommend the type short name format for error messages.
* Recommend the type fully qualified name in ``repr()``.

Python API
----------

Add ``type.__fully_qualified_name__`` read-only attribute, the fully
qualified name of a type: similar to
``f"{type.__module__}.{type.__qualname__}"`` or ``type.__qualname__`` if
``type.__module__`` is not a string or is equal to ``"builtins"``.

C API
-----

Add ``%T`` and ``%#T`` formats to ``PyUnicode_FromFormat()``, format
a type name:

* ``%T`` formats ``type.__name__``: the type "short name"
* ``%#T`` formats ``type.__fully_qualified_name__``: the type "fully
  qualified name".

The hash character (``#``) in the format string stands for
`alternative format
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language>`_.
For example, ``f"{123:x}"`` returns ``'7b'`` and ``f"{123:#x}"`` returns
``'0x7b'`` (``#`` adds ``0x`` prefix).

Both formats expect a type object. Example of usage::

Add also the ``PyType_GetFullyQualName()`` function to get the
``__fully_qualified_name__`` attribute of a type.

Type names should not be truncated. For example, the ``"%.100s"`` format
should be avoided.

For example, the code::

    PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError,
                 "__format__ must return a str, not %.200s",
                 Py_TYPE(result)->tp_name);

can be replaced with::

    PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError,
                 "__format__ must return a str, not %T",
                 Py_TYPE(result));

Recommendations
---------------

The type short name format is recommended for error messages. Example in
Python::

    XXX

Example in C::

    PyErr_Format(PyExc_TypeError,
                 "__format__ must return a str, not %T",
                 Py_TYPE(result));

The type fully qualified name is recommended in ``repr()``. Example in
Python::

    XXX


Out of the PEP scope
====================

Add ``__fully_qualified_name__`` attributes to other types:

* Coroutine
* Function
* Generator
* Method

By the way, modules have no ``__qualname__`` attribute. A module name,
``module.__name__``, is the fully qualified name.


Rejected Ideas
==============

Change str(type)
----------------

The ``type.__str__()`` method can be modified to format a type name
differently. For example, to format the fully qualified name.

The problem is that it's an incompatible change. For example, ``enum``,
``functools``, ``optparse``, ``pdb`` and ``xmlrpc.server`` modules of
the standard library have to be updated. And ``test_dataclasses``,
``test_descrtut`` and ``test_cmd_line_script`` have to be updated as
well.

See the `pull request: type(str) returns the fully qualified name
<https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/112129>`_.


Add !t formatter to get an object type in format()
--------------------------------------------------

Use ``f"{obj!t:T}"`` to format ``type(obj).__name__``.


Add formats to type.__format__()
--------------------------------

Proposed formats:

* ``f"{type(obj):z}"`` formats ``type(obj).__name__``.
* ``f"{type(obj):M.T}"`` formats ``type(obj).__fully_qualified_name__``.
* ``f"{type(obj):M:T}"`` formats ``type(obj).__fully_qualified_name__``
  using colon (``:``) separator.

Using short format (such as a single letter ``z``) requires to refer to
format documentation to understand how a type name is formatted, whereas
``type(obj).__name__`` is explicit.

The dot character (``.``) is already used for the "precision" in format
strings. The colon character (``:``) is already used to separated the
expression from the format specification. For example, ``f"{3.14:g}"``
uses ``g`` format which comes after ``:``. Usually, a format type is a
single format, such as ``g`` in ``f"{3.14:g}"``, not ``M.T`` or ``M:T``.
Reusing dot and colon characters for a different purpose can be
misleading and make the format parser more complicated.


Use colon separator in fully qualified name
-------------------------------------------

The colon (``:``) separator eliminates guesswork when you want to import
the name, see ``pkgutil.resolve_name()``. A type fully qualified name
can be formatted as ``f"{type.__module__}:{type.__qualname__}"``, or
``type.__qualname__`` if the module is ``"builtins"``.

In the standard library, no code formats a type fully qualified name
this way.

It is already tricky to get a type from its qualified name. The type
qualified name already uses the dot (``.``) separator between different
parts: class name, ``<locals>``, nested class name, etc.

The colon separator is not consistent with dot separator used in module
fully qualified name (``module.__name__``).


Other ways to format type names in C
------------------------------------

The ``PyUnicode_FromFormat()`` function supports multiple size
modifiers: ``hh`` (``char``), ``h`` (``short``), ``l``, ``ll``, ``z``,
``t``, ``j``.  The following length modifiers can be used to format a
type name:

* ``%hhT`` formats ``type.__name__``.
* ``%hT`` formats ``type.__qualname__``.
* ``%T`` formats ``type.__fully_qualified_name__``.

Other proposed formats:

* ``"%Q"``
* ``%lT`` formats ``type.__fully_qualified_name__``.

Having more formats to format type names can lead to inconsistencies
between different modules and make the API more error prone.

To format a type qualified name, ``f"{type.__qualname__}"`` can be used
in Python and ``PyType_GetQualName()`` can be used in C.


Pass an instance to %T format in C: omit Py_TYPE()
--------------------------------------------------

It was proposed to format a type name from a instance, like::

    PyErr_Format(..., "type %T", obj);

The intent is to avoid ``Py_TYPE()`` which returns a borrowed reference
to the type. Using a borrowed referencen can cause bug or crash if the
type is finalized or deallocated while being used.

In practice, it's unlikely that a type is finalized while the error
message is formatted. Instances of static types cannot see their type
being deallocated: static types are never deallocated. Instances of heap
types hold a strong reference to their type (in ``PyObject.ob_type``)
and it's safe to make the assumption that the code holds a strong
reference to the formatted object, so the object type cannot be
deallocated.

In short, using ``Py_TYPE(obj)`` to format an error message is safe.

If the ``%T`` format expects an instance, formatting a **type** name
cannot use ``%T`` format, whereas it's a common operation in extensions
of the standard library. So the ``%T`` format would only cover half of
cases. If the ``%T`` format takes a type, all cases are covered.


Other APIs to get a type fully qualified name
---------------------------------------------

* ``type.__fullyqualname__`` attribute
* Add a function to the ``inspect`` module


Omit __main__ in the type fully qualified name
----------------------------------------------

The ``pdb`` module formats a type fully qualified names in a similar way
than proposed ``type.__fully_qualified_name__`` but omits the module if
the module is equal to ``"__main__"``.

The ``unittest`` module formats a type fully qualified names the same
way than proposed ``type.__fully_qualified_name__``: only omits the
module if the module is equal to ``"builtins"``.
